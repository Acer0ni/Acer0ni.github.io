Not the most technically challenging project by any means, but from that point on I was hooked. I simply had to know how these things worked.</p><p>From that first simple lesson, family has played a huge role in my progression as a programmer. What started as a fun project with Gramps turned into a lifelong shared passion, and now has become the means of providing for my own family. Including my daughter who recently had her very first programming lesson, at the age of 4 just like I did.</p><p>I love the idea of using my skills as a programmer to build technologies that improve the lives of the people around me. One example of this is a project I worked on in college that utilized BCI(Brain Computer Interfacing), and it has been a lifelong goal of mine to increase the accessibility of computers for everyone.</p><p>As a Developer I chase that high from solving that bug. I prefer to work with the complex logic of the backend, than trying to make things look nice on the front end. I am currently playing with Django-Ninja and absolutely loving it, and want to use it for everything I&rsquo;m writing for personal use.</p><p>Technologies I am currently using: Django, Django-Ninja, Mongoose, Python, Javascript, Postgres
Technologies next on my list to look at: TypeScript, Ruby, Pygame</p><p>Currently, I am in the planning stage of a paper crypto trading site. (I&rsquo;m hoping my team will let me talk them into using a Django-Ninja framework)</p><p>PC Spec:</p><p>GPU: ROG Strix 2060</p><p>CPU: Intel i5 9400f</p><p>ram: Teamgroup T-force Vulcan Z 16GB @ 2666 mhz</p><p>storage: 500gb nvme ssd 2x 8TB HDDs 5400RPM</p><p>PSU: Rosewill 700W</p><p>cooler: stock Intel</p><p>mobo: MSI B365</p></div></article><hr><div class=post-info></div></main></div><footer class=footer></footer></div><script type=text/javascript src=/bundle.min.cf7fb2a9e24608a783e05e4472da2fdf008293289de1ad88d1cba5c143e7e414496dd33b6a228e92f8461ce0c8cbad3c9f9847e73e46dfbce0463393ddd1733a.js integrity="sha512-z3+yqeJGCKeD4F5Ectov3wCCkyid4a2I0culwUPn5BRJbdM7aiKOkvhGHODIy608n5hH5z5G37zgRjOT3dFzOg=="></script></body></html>
