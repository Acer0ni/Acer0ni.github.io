One of my earliest memories in the world of programming was my grandfather teaching me how to change the screensaver in Windows 95 when I was about 4 years old. Not the most technically challenging project by any means, but from that point on I was hooked. I simply had to know how these things worked. 

From that first simple lesson, family has played a huge role in my progression as a programmer. What started as a fun project with Gramps turned into a lifelong shared passion, and now has become the means of providing for my own family. Including my daughter who recently had her very first programming lesson, at the age of 4 just like I did. 

I love the idea of using my skills as a programmer to build technologies that improve the lives of the people around me. One example of this is a project I worked on in college that utilized  BCI(Brain Computer Interfacing), and it has been a lifelong goal of mine to increase the accessibility of computers for everyone.

Currently, I am in the planning stage of a paper crypto trading site.
