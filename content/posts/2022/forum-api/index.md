![db-icon](/db-picture.png)This is a database for a user-generated chat forum that is ready to be paired with a front-end UI. It uses the Django-Ninja framework, Postgres, and cookie based authentication. Intended for use as a technology forum but is suitable for multiple industries.

This project started off as a full stack app to be my capstone project for my bootcamp. It was intended to be a technology forum for me and my cohorts to compile our resources.we had five days to complete this project.

not knowing anything about django-ninja coming or anything about cookie based authentication i spent more time studying i did in this week then coding and did not finish the front end.but did end up with a fully functional secure api with cookie based authentication.

one immediate challenge was the lack of django-ninja docs written on a beginner level. so there was a lot of struggle trying to fit django-ninja into what i already knew about DRF 

i had a lot of fun with django-ninjas auto-docs.they made testing very easy. My most valuable lesson from this project came in the form of setting realistic expectations when incorporating a new technology into a build. Django-Ninja did make the process much quicker once I had done enough research to fully understand it, however I underestimated the amount of time it took to get to that point which caused a delay in finishing the project.
