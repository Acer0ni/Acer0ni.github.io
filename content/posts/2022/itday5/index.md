Today I spent my code signal time failing again to solve [almostIncreasingSequence](https://app.codesignal.com/arcade/intro/level-2/2mxbGwLzvkTCKAJMG). After talking to a friend about it, I think I may have a solution that I plan to test out over the weekend. It was the last day of the Google workspace course and it ended with [Planning for a Google Workspace Deployment](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/93). This course was based on a company of about 250 people who were switching over from a legacy provider. In practice, it was kind of like a review and I didn't learn anything new with it, and a lot of what they were saying was hard to follow without some experience in IT or having ever even been in a company with 250 people in it. It was kind of like the rest of the courses had been giving me puzzle pieces and this one was putting the puzzle together. In truth this is probably the only course I wouldn't recommend to someone starting off learning it, without some real-world experience it had little to offer.
