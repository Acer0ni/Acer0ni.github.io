Struggled for another hour on almostincreamenting, tried some things that didn't work, and starting to feel fairly frustrated with it but I am sure it's a little detail I will feel dumb about missing once I get it. For the coursework today I did two more applications in the google suite, [Google Slides](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/197) and [Google Sheets](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/196). They follow the same format as the previous courses I have done this week.

Google Sheets is fascinating, I have never had a need to really use a spreadsheet(i mean I dont play EVE online) but have always heard stories about how powerful they can be seeing it in action were very cool but I also feel like I would need another month of studying it and using it before I had a good knowledge base on it. Google Slides is a PowerPoint competitor that seems to function very similarly but is connected to google clouds drive and can utilize some of the other applications in google suite.
