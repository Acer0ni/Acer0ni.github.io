Well, I knew I had a lot to do today so I jumped into coursework as soon as I woke up and decided to skip the code signal today, it's honestly starting to feel pointless for me anyway as I feel like I dont have enough time to code.

So on we went with our good friend professor messer with the [SY0-601 Training Course](https://www.professormesser.com/security-plus/sy0-601/sy0-601-video/sy0-601-comptia-security-plus-course/)
We started off talking about architecture and design, learning about how to protect data, how to prevent data loss, and oddly in this section honey pots, which is a machine on your network that you leave insecure on purpose to trap hackers, although I thinking trapping is the wrong word because there is nothing from just getting up and walking away from there computer. but basically, its to try and learn what methods an attacker would use to learn how to defend from it. we then talked about cloud computing, and its benefits of it as far as security(in some cases someone else does it for you). we then talked about some secure coding techniques, some of them I knew, like keeping your data validated by the server, but what I found funny is a friend of mine who works in security told me his job was basically to convince devs that security by obfuscation is a bad idea, but here professor messer recommended it. so maybe thats a hot topic in the coding world. we then talked about resilience in data, having 3 copies of all data, on three different types of media in two different locations, and the RAID technology which allows HDDs to act as one. we ended the day with physical security, which I have been over a lot with both him and John Strand last week, but I did learn that sometimes actual moats are used to protect data centers, so thats pretty funny.
