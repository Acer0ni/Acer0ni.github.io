Well not gonna lie, I was so frustrated by CodeSignal yesterday that I skipped it today in favor of spending more time trying to understand networking. but I do have some ideas on how to approach it after a talk with a friend, the finding the right parentheses problem is solved by first finding the first closing and going backward looking for the opening. but im still fuzzy on how to go backward.

As for networking I restarted the [N10-008 Training Course](https://www.professormesser.com/network-plus/n10-008/n10-008-video/n10-008-training-course/) and spent several hours trying to make heads or tails out of subnetting math and gave up and decided to try and watch some videos on some things I already had some knowledge on and just continued with the videos. I had heard of DHCP before so I started with that set of videos, and while I could use another pass through the material I had a more fruitful day than yesterday. While I could not understand all of it, it was fun to hear about the different types of networking devices, switches, routers, and hubs. Tomorrow im going to do more of the same and I think I will just avoid the topics that are completely perplexing to me and save them for last.
