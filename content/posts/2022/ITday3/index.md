Started off the day with code signal, as usual, solved [Make Array Consecutive 2](https://app.codesignal.com/arcade/intro/level-2/bq2XnSr5kbHqpHGJC) pretty easily, although I did have to spend a few minutes looking for a solution without recursion. Today's course was [Google Workspace Security](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/48). It went over the security features of Google workspace and how to use them. There was a lot more reading than usual for the courses. Although I did do things like setting up and enforcing 2fa on a company-wide level, and changing session controls so that users will log out more often and single sign-on. This is where the struggles started for me, a combination of not reading the directions carefully and poorly worded directions didn't make it clear that I was supposed to make a [15five account](https://www.15five.com/) before setting anything up. Once I caught that mistake and had it set up correctly it still did not work. I tested it on another account and realized that the SSO was failing because it was trying to sign up using OAuth instead of sso. Once I took 15five's OAuth permission away it all worked perfectly. After that, it was log viewing time which once again was pretty boring because of no activity.
