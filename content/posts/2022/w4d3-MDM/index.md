Started this morning by solving [commonCharacterCount
](https://app.codesignal.com/arcade/intro/level-3/JKKuHJknZNj4YGL32) after being one test short of it last night and then quickly solved [isLucky](https://app.codesignal.com/arcade/intro/level-3/3AdBC97QNuhF6RwsQ). For course work, we are still in Macland but today I went over [Learn How to Deploy and Manage Apple Devices](https://it-training.apple.com/tutorials/apt-deployment). Which is a bunch of really well-written articles on how to deploy Apple devices for your company. It seems like yesterday was a little bit of foreshadowing and the main focus today was MDMs and how to use them. Honestly, a lot of it I didn't follow and I felt like maybe there was a base knowledge that the author assumed I would have but I didn't.I look forward to learning more about MDM. it is a very interesting topic.
