Well, today started as most Monday due, to me staring at code signal trying to figure out [reverseInParentheses](https://app.codesignal.com/arcade/intro/level-3/9DgaPsE2a7M6M2Hu6) with no progress, as is starting to become a pattern after I was done working for the day I came up with an idea to correctly add the third portion of the string after the middle has been reversed, and while that worked kind of it shined a light on several other factors that I had been dealing with wrong, like how I grabbed the parentheses and how I was overwriting my work every time I found new parentheses set. I think it may be back to the drawing board from scratch on this one, but maybe I will have another good idea at an inopportune time.

as far as coursework went today I honestly wish I could say it went better but it may have been worse honestly. I started studying for the [N10-008](https://www.professormesser.com/network-plus/n10-008/n10-008-video/n10-008-training-course/) cert. Networking has never been my strong suit and while I think I understand it at a very high level as soon as it starts to lose me. I decided today would be the end of that and this is something I will get. but for now, it felt like I was in a matching class I wasn't prepared for as my good friend professor messor went over the math behind subnets and the very specifics of the different types of networking cables. I watched every video I watched today twice in hopes to make sense of it all and can't say I made much progress and did not get all of the videos I was supposed to watch today. I dont see a point in going forward with the course so tomorrow I will start where I started to get lost worry less about what I need to get done for the day and take more time studying things that confuse me and trying to take better notes.
