# Meet Addy

![addy-help](/project-pictures/addy-help.png)

I started this project as a way to break out of the rut I found myself in during the planning phase for a much larger app. With no concrete intentions, other than exploring a few different APIs and building something cool, I started writing, researching, experimenting, and now I’m extremely happy to present the result of this endeavour: Addy the Discord Bot.

Addy doesn’t have a central theme as she really was meant to be a personal project, thus each of her commands came about simply from asking myself “Wouldn’t it be cool if…?”

- A backend to complement her, and allow to me save data more reliably.

- A way for her to play music in a voice channel (worried about the legality here).

- A Runescape item price look-up. (Their api is really bad, the easiest way to do this is to build a webcrawler and crawl their api once a week)

- If you have a cool idea for Addy, contact me and let me know!

If you are interested in seeing Addy in action, I have set up a [discord server](https://discord.gg/a5EXHbGwzH) for you to try. The browser version of discord doesn't require you to log in.
