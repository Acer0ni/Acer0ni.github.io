My brain felt like it was trying to come out of my skull all day today, I assumed it was because my body was experiencing what it was like to be without caffeine for the first time in fifteen years, but evolved into a full-grown migraine by the time my coffee was brewed and in my cup. So i started off my very foggy morning started with [Sort by Height
](https://app.codesignal.com/arcade/intro/level-3/D6qmdBL2NYz49XHwM0) which honestly i couldn't even get a concrete enough answer that was worth submitting today.

for coursework today it was once again not a course but more so a study guide on using MDMs in the Apple ecosystem. A lot of it included the networking aspect which I felt like I once again lacked a certain base knowledge to quite follow easily. But on the bright side, a friend sent me [MicroMDM](https://micromdm.io/) but told me it was probably too complicated for me but im going to give it a shot anyway as I learn best by doing and I haven't had a chance to do a lot this week.
