CodeSignal today went better than it has before. I solved [alternatingSums](https://app.codesignal.com/arcade/intro/level-4/cC5QuL9fqvZjXJsW9) without problems as it was fairly easy. I moved on to [Add Border](https://app.codesignal.com/arcade/intro/level-4/ZCD7NQnED724bJtjN), and I always have these draw a picture with code. I think at the end of the time, I had a good idea what I needed to do now I just need to figure it out how to do it without a million for loops.

For class today I continued [SOC Core Skills ](https://www.antisyphontraining.com/soc-core-skills-w-john-strand/) with John Strand. We started with checking out a memory dump using Volatility, which you can use to look at all the ports open at the time of the dump. Next, we moved on to RITA, or real intelligence threat analytics. This was cool, it gave an easy-to-read GUI of domains connecting to your network to pretty easily see anomalies. After seeing it in RITA, we moved into viewing AC hunter which seemed to give the same information, but in a much more futuristic GUI.
