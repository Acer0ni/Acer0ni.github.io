Yay a Saturday blog post, my work week is weird this week with me being sick on Thursday. Today's coursework was more Atlassian products starting with [Confluence Fundamentals](https://university.atlassian.com/student/path/861302-confluence-fundamentals?sid=91d51f44-e700-4d9a-bb7c-100283701aa5&sid_i=1), which is an application that I'm assuming companies are using when they say have a company wiki. It followed the same pattern as yesterday's courses, small paragraphs followed by diagrams to explain, topped off with a quiz at the end to make sure you comprehend it. It took me through how to set up and edit pages, explained how to share them with my colleagues, and made sure to cover the best practices.

The next course was [Trello Fundamentals](https://university.atlassian.com/student/path/1043254-trello-fundamentals-how-to-use-trello?sid=91d51f44-e700-4d9a-bb7c-100283701aa5&sid_i=3) that took me through the basics of Trello. The course was set up exactly the same as the last three. It took me through how to set up boards and lists, and how to edit cards so they are visually pleasing as well as going over best practices of Trello. Trello seems like a cool app but it also seems to follow a lot of the same use case as Jira, but maybe a little bit more personal. Aside from some of the more advanced features these courses probably could be skipped by the more tech intuitive, as both applications are very well designed and intuitive to use.
