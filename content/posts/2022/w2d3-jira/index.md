Today I overslept a bit because I didn't feel well yesterday, so I decided to skip Codesignal and moved right into coursework. I have moved beyond Okta for now and am diving into the world of Jira, which starts off by me taking [Jira Fundamentals](https://university.atlassian.com/student/path/815443-jira-fundamentals?sid=91d51f44-e700-4d9a-bb7c-100283701aa5&sid_i=0) and [Jira Service Management Fundamentals](https://university.atlassian.com/student/path/968311-jira-service-management-fundamentals?sid=91d51f44-e700-4d9a-bb7c-100283701aa5&sid_i=2). The course is short paragraphs followed by a GIF to show you what they are explaining, with little quizzes at the end of each chapter to make sure you are staying caught up. After each course is a 30-question quiz that you must pass or wait a day to retake.

Jira itself looked very cool, not something I think I could get much of out of my personal career, but it was like Github issues on steroids. Both courses talked about very similar things. Being very similar products, a lot of time was spent on issues and their lifecycle of them along with some Jira best practices. All in all, it was all stuff I probably would have been able to pick up on the fly. Jira seems very intuitive, but a fun way to spend the day and learn about a neat piece of software.
