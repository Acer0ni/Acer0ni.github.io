Well, I cheated over the weekend and got help on almostincreasing. I still need to study the answer because I do not understand it, but this morning I tried to redeem myself by solving [matrixElementsSum](https://app.codesignal.com/arcade/intro/level-2/xskq4ZxLyqQMCLshr) and [All Longest Strings](https://app.codesignal.com/arcade/intro/level-3/fzsCQGYbxaEcTr2bL) almost immediately. Although, matrixEWlementSum took me a little longer to get it's more edge cases.

This week for course work it's all about mac baby, I have acquired an older intel silicon mac to work on, so that I don't have to learn how to factory reset on my machine. This is a week I'm pretty excited about, because it's going to teach me more about this machine I've been using for ten months or so. I started today with [Learn How To Support Apple Devices - Mac](https://it-training.apple.com/tutorials/apt-support#setting-up-and-restoring-mac), or at least certain parts of it. The course recommends that I skip the iPhone and iPad stuff. This isn't a course per se as much as a bunch of related tutorials.

Things started rocky almost immediately. I realized that a lot of the commands are different for intel and apple silicon, so the tutorials that I'm reading for apple silicon won't work for the intel silicon MacBook that I am working on. In the end, it wasn't the biggest of issues, because the intel silicone operations are also very well documented, it just meant I had to go find them myself. I learned how to factory reset a MacBook in several different ways, how to troubleshoot my network, how the keychain works, and how to transfer data from an old MacBook to a new one. I did not get as far as I planned today as I went to turn on the intel MacBook to learn how to airdrop and it is currently not booting, So I guess thats where I start tomorrow.
