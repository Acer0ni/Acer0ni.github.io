This morning's code signal did not go that well, while I think my recursion idea would probably work, my method for grabbing the first closing parentheses won't work so I need to figure out a grab the last parentheses in a string, also when I am splitting the string into thirds I need to figure out the proper way to add the last third back more reliably, it is crashing right now sometimes failing to find parentheses and I am not entirely sure why my guard clause is not helping with that.

Coursework wasnâ€™t coursework today although i did spend a few hours rewatching some videos I felt should be watched again whether it was me being distracted during it or just not getting it very clearly. but after that I started on the practice tests I started with the recommendation of [Comptia](https://www.comptia.org/training/resources/practice-tests) and requested a few different types of their practice test, to my dismay there was only 38 practice. which I scored 33/38 total on and was pretty pleased with the results. Afterward, I was sent [Become](https://uniontestprep.com/) which had a lot more questions on it. So I started to dove into them and was still feeling pretty good through most of it, though things like networking I did horrible on. overall I got a 79% on the tests. Which is a little lower than I would like to be but now I have things I know I need to study over the weekend. This was a pretty fun week learning about all sorts of computer things and im kinda sad it's over.
