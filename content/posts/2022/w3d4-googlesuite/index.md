Today we continued on our google suite adventures by taking two courses,[ Google Meet and Google Chat](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/198) and [Google Sheets - Advanced Topics](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/293). They both followed what I had dubbed the google suite format. Videos with small exercises, a quiz periodically, and at the end a small capstone project.

The google meet and chat course was fairly similar to the other social google apps, and talked about how to set up and join meetings and the basics of google chat. The Google sheets advanced course was much more exciting and went more into depth on how to use functions with Sheets, how to add charts and graphs from your data, as well as conditionally formatting your doc. It was a pretty fun course and has enticed me how to learn sheets properly.
