Well, after being put off by almost a week due to a freak power outage, today was day one of my eight-week IT crash course put together by my [friend](https://0xda.de/). It started off a little rocky as the [Introduction to Google Workspace Administration](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/90) I followed today, assuming I was starting fresh and buying a domain and letting google set up their DNS records. Since I already had a domain, and no spare money, I decided not to do this and go through with using my own domain for this course. It took me a while to realize I needed to set up my own MX records, and I should have already done so before I backtracked and followed googles instructions on adding the correct MX records, which of course failed their tests right away. After an embarrassingly long time, I read the instructions again and see that some registrars require a "." at the end of the value. So I added my "."'s and went on with my course.

From here it was like a guided walkthrough of Google workspace. It took me through the features and had me do a little task in each. Things like adding users, making mailing groups, settings different users, and groups of users to have different permissions. All and all it was a fun course to go through and see some of the tools an IT manager has at their disposal and I look forward to what tomorrow brings me.

Codesignal was un-eventful today, I completed this [Shape area](https://app.codesignal.com/arcade/intro/level-2/yuGuHvcCaFCKk56rJ). I looked for a pattern to no avail for a solid 15 minutes. Before going to google to look up what the heck an interesting polygon was and was met with thousands of answers to this exact same problem. Not understanding most of them, and not being comfortable "borrowing" code that I don't understand, I spent a while finding an answer.
