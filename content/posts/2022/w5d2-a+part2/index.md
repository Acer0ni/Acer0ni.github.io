Well, today started a little later than I wanted to because it was my daughter's first day of kindergarten, and the line to drop her off was three blocks long. I made some slight progress on the code signal, I remembered that i could split the string by parentheses but I'm not sure how to grab the closing one parentheses.

As for course work today, I continued on my journey with the [220-1101 Training Course](https://www.professormesser.com/free-a-plus-training/220-1101/220-1101-video/220-1101-training-course/). It was a lot of reviews today starting with motherboards and there various form factors and slots. Then it went into the two different types of major CPUs, intel and AMD, and their differences. Then went into a brief history lesson on the architecture of CPUs. Then we talked about printers, which I had never really bothered to look up how they worked and was surprised to see inkjets use heat to dry the ink quickly. I always thought that the heat from a freshly printed page was from the friction of the printer head. It was also funny to see some of the printers at my old job that I had done maintenance on, even though I wasn't qualified. All-in-all it was a very thorough tutorial if not a bit dry and I would recommend it to anyone looking to get the A+ cert.
