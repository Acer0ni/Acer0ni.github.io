Started off to a not-so-great day starting with making no progress on code signal today. The nested parentheses of the problem stump me. Although, as I am typing this I realized I might be able to use recursion to do it, after I identify the first parentheses, grab the whole substring and call the method again with the substring. That may work, I will have to try it tomorrow morning.

Regarding course work, it involved more videos in [220-1102 Training Course](https://www.professormesser.com/free-a-plus-training/220-1102/220-1102-video/220-1102-training-course/), and totally was really all about security from physical to network. Like I said, it started with physical security and some things to think of when setting up offices or working in public places on secure data. It then went over the different types of attacks, and explained them on a very high level, e.g DDOS, SQL injections, social engineering, zero-day attacks, and cross-site scripting attacks. It was all fascinating, but because it was at such a high level I knew most of it. I did learn that the log4j vulnerability that happened back in December also clued engineers into several other vulnerabilities that were patched shortly after. It also talked about how to destroy your data safely (if you wanna be thorough burn the hard drive). It was a very thorough tutorial and I recommend it to anyone taking the test.
