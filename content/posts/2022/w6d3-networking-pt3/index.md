Welp, today for code signal, I did not write much code but instead study on what a stack is and how to use it, which is a last in first out data structure and you seem to make it with a list with .append(). I couldn't think of a way to implement it though with this current problem but I feel like im getting close, although I thought this once before and ended up deleting all of that code. So who knows what tomorrow brings?

As for course work today I attempted to continue along with the [N10-008 Training Course](https://www.professormesser.com/network-plus/n10-008/n10-008-video/n10-008-training-course/), and honestly didn't have a lot of progress I felt like my head was in a fog. I started with ethernet switching and wireless frequencies. The ethernet stuff was mostly way over my head and I will probably watch it tomorrow, the internet frequencies are like my worst nightmare. A lot of things are very closely named, and it's definitely going to be a headache to remember it all.
