Well today was a little weird for me as will all of this week, I normally wake up with codesignal, but the class I am taking starts at that time, so codesignal ended my day instead of started it. I did not get it quite done, but I did get the string separated and reversed correctly.

As for course work, I decided to disregard my sylabus, and instead take Antispyhon's [SOC Core Skills ](https://www.antisyphontraining.com/soc-core-skills-w-john-strand/) with John Strand. Which is a pay what you can live 5-day course hosted online, in which we will cover what he calls the security basics like core networking skill, forensics and the incident response process. Today not a lot of content was covered as it was a lot of set up and introductions and the like. We did learn about something called wireshark which is a nifty piece of software the snoops data across the network. I think I meant to do a little more research on it and go over its lab again today, but as I sat down on the couch with my MacBook, I realised the VM is on my Desktop.
