Well today was a little wierd for me as will all of this week, i normally wake up with codesignal but the class i am taking starts at that time, so codesignal ended my day instead of started it, i did not get it quite done but i did get the string seperated and reveresed correctly.

as for course work i decided to disregard my sylabus and instead take Antispyhon's [SOC Core Skills ](https://www.antisyphontraining.com/soc-core-skills-w-john-strand/) with John Strand. Which is a pay what you can live 5-day course hosted online. in which we will cover what he calls the security basics like core networking skill, forensics and the incident response process. Today not a lot of content was covered as it was a lot of set up and introductions and the like, we did lesrn about something called wireshark which is a nifty peice of software the snoops data across the network, i think i meant to do a little more research on it and go over its lab again today but as i sat down on the couch with my MacBook i realised the VM is on my Desktop.
