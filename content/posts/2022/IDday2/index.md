Today I started late due to a doctor's appointment in the morning that ended up taking about half of the time that I would prefer to be working so I skipped codesignal today and jumped to my next course as soon as I got home. Today I took [Managing Google Workspace](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/92). It followed the same format as the last one: an intro video to introduce the section, a couple of guided assignments followed by a quiz to ensure you understood it. Today was a bit of a struggle because the course is slightly outdated and google has moved or renamed elements but Google Workspace is set up very logically. Once I realized that I was following the wrong instructions it was not usually hard to explore around and find where they moved the setting I was looking for.

It took me through managing some of the more popular Google apps from a business side things like, calendar,gmail, and vault. I did things like set a data retention plan in google vault, close off access to certain apps at a company level and a group level, transfer ownership of files from a deleted account to an active one, and view the audit logs. today was undoubtedly less interesting today than it was yesterday, some things I only read through and couldn't do like adding a second domain or creating a mobile account, and the log section was practically empty due to the fact that I don't have a company. all and all a good course and I am excited to see what tomorrow brings me.
