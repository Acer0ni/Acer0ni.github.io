Today started strong with me finally getting over some blockers and making progress in [almostIncreasingSequence](https://app.codesignal.com/arcade/intro/level-2/2mxbGwLzvkTCKAJMG), only to find new ones. My method right now permanently deletes `x + 1` in the list, but sometimes X needs to be deleted and I need to figure out a way to decipher that. As far as course work goes I started Otka training today, or attempted to. My 8-week IT crash course has me taking the next few days [Okta Basics Curriculum for Workforce Identity](https://www.okta.com/training/okta-basics-curriculum-for-workforce-identity). I was held back originally by the site having latency issues which cut into a significant portion of my work day. Once the site was back up I started going to the lessons. They were not as nice as the Google workspace lessons, but they will do fine. The ones I took today covered some terms that they will be using and how to add users to add to Okta, as well as whatkta is, an identity as a service platform that helps corporate users manage their single login.
