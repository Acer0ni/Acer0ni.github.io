I made some progress on [almostIncreasingSequence](https://app.codesignal.com/arcade/intro/level-2/2mxbGwLzvkTCKAJMG) by getting rid of everything I had, and rewriting it using zip to pair off the list and comparing the pairs. For my coursework, I continue on [Okta Basics Curriculum for Workforce Identity](https://www.okta.com/training/okta-basics-curriculum-for-workforce-identity). It was not designed for someone without the hardware to run okta on. The course is mostly just articles to read, with some short videos in between. There are some more involved things to do if you do happen to have a windows server lying around, but I read through them instead. It started with how to source your users from Okta, an active directory, or an LDP. We then went over how users would log in, both with an SSO and using MFA, and talked about lifecycle management. Things I also read about today, are how Okta and Office265 work together, how to manage API and server access, and how to set up Okta on mobile.
