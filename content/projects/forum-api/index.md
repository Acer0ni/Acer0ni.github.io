![db-icon](/project-pictures/db-picture.png)This is a database for a user-generated chat forum that is ready to be paired with a front-end UI. It uses the Django-Ninja framework, Postgres, and cookie based authentication. Intended for use as a technology forum, but is suitable for multiple industries.

This project started off as a full stack app, intending to be my capstone project for my bootcamp. It was meant to be a technology forum for me and my cohorts to compile our resources. We had five days to complete this project.

Not knowing anything about Django-Ninja coming in, or anything about cookie based authentication, I spent more time studying than coding, and did not finish the front end. However, I did end up with a fully functional secure api with cookie based authentication.

One immediate challenge was the lack of Django-Ninja docs written on a beginner level. So there was a lot of struggle trying to fit django-ninja into what i already knew about DRF.

I had a lot of fun with Django-Ninjas auto-docs. They made testing very easy. My most valuable lesson from this project came in the form of setting realistic expectations when incorporating a new technology into a build. Django-Ninja did make the process much quicker once I had done enough research to fully understand it, however I underestimated the amount of time it took to get to that point which caused a delay in finishing the project.
