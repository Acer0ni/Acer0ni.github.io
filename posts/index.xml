Towards the end of the day I had an idea about using .index() to grab the second parentheses, so I typed all of that out and was working on trying to fine-tune it, and carefully reread the instructions and realized how they wanted me to handle the nested parentheses was not how I was doing it and the way I was doing it wouldn&rsquo;t work. So I am back to square one tomorrow and just hoping to come up with an idea between now and tomorrow morning.</p>
<p>As far as course work was involved, it was <a href="https://www.professormesser.com/free-a-plus-training/220-1102/220-1102-video/220-1102-training-course/">220-1102 Training Course</a>, which was more of the same from the last two videos, just very thorough youtube videos. A lot of reviews here, as it talked about different operating systems starting with Windows, which I&rsquo;ve been using since Windows 95 so I am fairly familiar with it. It went into the basic features of macOS, which honestly would have been a great thing for me to watch about a year ago before I got my mac, but between near everyday use and having already spent a week learning about macOS, there was not a lot there either. It then went on to talk about Linux command prompts and its features, which are fairly similar to macs it was also just a lot of review. I ended at the beginning of the security section which is not a place I am super familiar with and hope to learn a lot about it tomorrow.</p>

As for course work today, I continued on my journey with the 220-1101 Training Course.</description><content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Well, today started a little later than I wanted to because it was my daughter&rsquo;s first day of kindergarten, and the line to drop her off was three blocks long.

It was a lot of reviews today starting with motherboards and there various form factors and slots. Then it went into the two different types of major CPUs, intel and AMD, and their differences. Then went into a brief history lesson on the architecture of CPUs. Then we talked about printers, which I had never really bothered to look up how they worked and was surprised to see inkjets use heat to dry the ink quickly. I always thought that the heat from a freshly printed page was from the friction of the printer head. It was also funny to see some of the printers at my old job that I had done maintenance on, even though I wasn&rsquo;t qualified. All-in-all it was a very thorough tutorial if not a bit dry and I would recommend it to anyone looking to get the A+ cert.</p>

CodeSignal was quite fruitful today, although I didn&amp;rsquo;t get a problem right, I feel like I almost have a good solution for reverseInParentheses. The basis of what I want to do is fairly simple. I need to go to every character in the input string and check if it is a parentheses, and once I find it I split the list into three pieces.</description><content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Monday mornings are my least favorite time of the week. CodeSignal was quite fruitful today, although I didn&rsquo;t get a problem right, I feel like I almost have a good solution for <a href="https://app.codesignal.com/arcade/intro/level-3/9DgaPsE2a7M6M2Hu6">reverseInParentheses</a>. The basis of what I want to do is fairly simple. I need to go to every character in the input string and check if it is a parentheses, and once I find it I split the list into three pieces. The pieces to the left of the parentheses, the characters inside the parentheses, and the rest of the string. Then you flip the string inside the parentheses, strip it of the parentheses, add it to the section of the string to the left of the parentheses, and continue looking for more in the rest of the string.</p>
<p>For course work today, I started speed running certificates beginning with <a href="https://www.professormesser.com/free-a-plus-training/220-1101/220-1101-video/220-1101-training-course/">220-1101 Training Course</a> which is the cert for basic IT knowledge stuff. The whole course is just youtube videos, with no interactiveness from the participant. It started by going over information about laptop hardware, and the difference between the different types of panels. Before going very in-depth about networks, and how to set them up. It was quite the info dump and I will have to revisit a lot of this when I start to study for the cert.</p>

<p>For coursework today, there was none! It was an independent day, so that means after spending a little longer than normal starting at code signal I got to watch podcasts all day. I planned on starting with <a href="https://podcast.macadmins.org/">Mac Admins</a>, but it was so good I spent the whole day watching them starting with <a href="https://podcast.macadmins.org/2022/07/25/episode-275-on-windows-365-and-the-mac/">Episode 275: On Windows 365 and the Mac</a>, which I thought would be a talk about some of the difficulties of making a windows product work on a mac. But instead, it was an interesting talk about how you should just rent a VM for the employees that needed access to windows products. Next on my list was <a href="https://podcast.macadmins.org/2022/06/27/episode-271-yubikeeeeyyyyyyssssss/">Episode 271: Yubikeeeeyyyyyyssssss</a>, which is a topic that I&rsquo;ve been kinda intrigued about since a friend mentioned them to me. It talked about the pros and cons of how to use a yubikey, as well as some best practices and some things to watch out for during a full deployment like costs, users losing them, and users not knowing how to use them properly. My final podcast for the night was <a href="https://podcast.macadmins.org/2022/02/14/episode-252-patch-management/">Episode 252: Patch Management</a>, which intrigued me. They talked about how to get users to want to update, as well as talking about why users won&rsquo;t want too. It was a great day, and I think I learned a lot without being stressed out with how much I had to get done.</p>

<p>For coursework today it was once again not a course but more so a study guide on using MDMs in the Apple ecosystem. A lot of it included the networking aspect which I felt like I once again lacked a certain base knowledge to follow easily. On the bright side, a friend sent me <a href="https://micromdm.io/">MicroMDM</a>, but told me it was probably too complicated for me. I&rsquo;m going to give it a shot anyway, as I learn best by doing, and I haven&rsquo;t had a chance to do a lot this week.</p>

My coursework was not a normal day. I started with the MacBook, which after being left on and plugged in overnight had still not booted to the login screen. After a hard reset, I noticed it progressed to about the exact spot and froze. I wasn&rsquo;t sure what was going on, so I went through the time-consuming process of repeating my steps yesterday thinking maybe something failed and I did not notice. After some time messing in the utilities I saw an install macOS. I thought maybe a fresh install might be needed but upon clicking install im greeted with an error box saying &ldquo;can not connect to update server&rdquo;. Seeing as it asked me to connect to my wifi each time I brought up the utilities I thought maybe the service was down, so I also tried it again in case something on my end was going wrong. After searching around the utilities looking for something that could be useful I look at the top of my screen and noticed I wasn&rsquo;t connected to wifi. I connected the wifi, went back to the install macOS page, and successfully started the install.</p>
<p>While that was happening, I turned to the coursework I was supposed to be doing <a href="https://training.apple.com/content/dam/appletraining/us/en/2022/documents/Apple%20Device%20Support%20Exam%20Prep%20Guide.pdf">Apple Device Support Exam Prep Guide</a>. Which is not a course as much as a giant list of things to learn. Not all of them very concrete ideas like &ldquo;learn what&rsquo;s new in macOS&rdquo;. I started with the section on installing macOS, because of the current problems with it, and started reading walkthroughs on how to do it. I ended my day getting distracted and reading about MDM, which is super exciting but I didn&rsquo;t have enough time to get a feel for them or find one to play with, but it is a way for admins to manage mobile devices for their company.</p>

I still need to study the answer because I do not understand it, but this morning I tried to redeem myself by solving <a href="https://app.codesignal.com/arcade/intro/level-2/xskq4ZxLyqQMCLshr">matrixElementsSum</a> and <a href="https://app.codesignal.com/arcade/intro/level-3/fzsCQGYbxaEcTr2bL">All Longest Strings</a> almost immediately. Although, matrixEWlementSum took me a little longer to get it&rsquo;s more edge cases.</p>
<p>This week for course work it&rsquo;s all about mac baby, I have acquired an older intel silicon mac to work on, so that I don&rsquo;t have to learn how to factory reset on my machine. This is a week I&rsquo;m pretty excited about, because it&rsquo;s going to teach me more about this machine I&rsquo;ve been using for ten months or so. I started today with <a href="https://it-training.apple.com/tutorials/apt-support#setting-up-and-restoring-mac">Learn How To Support Apple Devices - Mac</a>, or at least certain parts of it. The course recommends that I skip the iPhone and iPad stuff. This isn&rsquo;t a course per se as much as a bunch of related tutorials.</p>
<p>Things started rocky almost immediately. I realized that a lot of the commands are different for intel and apple silicon, so the tutorials that I&rsquo;m reading for apple silicon won&rsquo;t work for the intel silicon MacBook that I am working on. In the end, it wasn&rsquo;t the biggest of issues, because the intel silicone operations are also very well documented, it just meant I had to go find them myself. I learned how to factory reset a MacBook in several different ways, how to troubleshoot my network, how the keychain works, and how to transfer data from an old MacBook to a new one. I did not get as far as I planned today as I went to turn on the intel MacBook to learn how to airdrop and it is currently not booting, So I guess thats where I start tomorrow.</p>

<p>The google meet and chat course was fairly similar to the other social google apps, and talked about how to set up and join meetings and the basics of google chat. The Google sheets advanced course was much more exciting and went more into depth on how to use functions with Sheets, how to add charts and graphs from your data, as well as conditionally formatting your doc. It was a pretty fun course and has enticed me how to learn sheets properly.</p>

They follow the same format as the previous courses I have done this week.</p>
<p>Google Sheets is fascinating. I have never had a need to really use a spreadsheet(I mean I don&rsquo;t play EVE online), but have always heard stories about how powerful they can be. Seeing it in action was very cool, but I also feel like I would need another month of studying it and using it before I had a good knowledge base on it. Google Slides is a PowerPoint competitor that seems to function very similarly, but is connected to Google Clouds drive and can utilize some of the other applications in Google Suite.</p>

<p>These are honestly my favorite types to take as I feel, the way they are set up, I retain more of the information. As far as the course work itself, a lot of it was reviewed. I have been using Gmail for fifteen years for example, and I&rsquo;m the type of person who really enjoys seeing what settings an application has to offer. Except for Google Drive, as it wasn&rsquo;t really an application I had used before regularly. It has a lot more advanced sharing than i expected, and the fact that certain Google files don&rsquo;t count towards your space is also really clutch.</p>

The course was set up exactly the same as the last three. It took me through how to set up boards and lists, and how to edit cards so they are visually pleasing as well as going over best practices of Trello. Trello seems like a cool app but it also seems to follow a lot of the same use case as Jira, but maybe a little bit more personal. Aside from some of the more advanced features these courses probably could be skipped by the more tech intuitive, as both applications are very well designed and intuitive to use.</p>

<p>Jira itself looked very cool, not something I think I could get much of out of my personal career, but it was like Github issues on steroids. Both courses talked about very similar things. Being very similar products, a lot of time was spent on issues and their lifecycle of them along with some Jira best practices. All in all, it was all stuff I probably would have been able to pick up on the fly. Jira seems very intuitive, but a fun way to spend the day and learn about a neat piece of software.</p>

There are some more involved things to do if you do happen to have a windows server lying around, but I read through them instead. It started with how to source your users from Okta, an active directory, or an LDP. We then went over how users would log in, both with an SSO and using MFA, and talked about lifecycle management. Things I also read about today, are how Okta and Office265 work together, how to manage API and server access, and how to set up Okta on mobile.</p>

They were not as nice as the Google workspace lessons, but they will do fine. The ones I took today covered some terms that they will be using and how to add users to add to Okta, as well as what Okta is, an identity as a service platform that helps corporate users manage their single login.</p>

It was kind of like the rest of the courses had been giving me puzzle pieces and this one was putting the puzzle together. In truth this is probably the only course I wouldn&rsquo;t recommend to someone starting off learning it, without some real-world experience it had little to offer.</p>

It ended the course doing more google admin dashboard stuff, like setting up a block and allow list for incoming and outgoing emails, and how to set up a compliance filter to make sure that none of the employees are saying any naughty words. It&rsquo;s a very useful course in how to set all this up in google workspace.</p>

Once I caught that mistake and had it set up correctly it still did not work. I tested it on another account and realized that the SSO was failing because it was trying to sign up using OAuth instead of sso. Once I took 15five&rsquo;s OAuth permission away it all worked perfectly. After that, it was log viewing time which once again was pretty boring because of no activity.</p>

Today I took <a href="https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/92">Managing Google Workspace</a>. It followed the same format as the last one: an intro video to introduce the section, a couple of guided assignments followed by a quiz to ensure you understood it. Today was a bit of a struggle because the course is slightly outdated and google has moved or renamed elements but Google Workspace is set up very logically. Once I realized that I was following the wrong instructions it was not usually hard to explore around and find where they moved the setting I was looking for.</p>
<p>It took me through managing some of the more popular Google apps from a business side things like, calendar,gmail, and vault. I did things like set a data retention plan in google vault, close off access to certain apps at a company level and a group level, transfer ownership of files from a deleted account to an active one, and view the audit logs. today was undoubtedly less interesting today than it was yesterday, some things I only read through and couldn&rsquo;t do like adding a second domain or creating a mobile account, and the log section was practically empty due to the fact that I don&rsquo;t have a company. all and all a good course and I am excited to see what tomorrow brings me.</p>

It started off a little rocky as the <a href="https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/90">Introduction to Google Workspace Administration</a> I followed today, assuming I was starting fresh and buying a domain and letting google set up their DNS records. Since I already had a domain, and no spare money, I decided not to do this and go through with using my own domain for this course. It took me a while to realize I needed to set up my own MX records, and I should have already done so before I backtracked and followed googles instructions on adding the correct MX records, which of course failed their tests right away. After an embarrassingly long time, I read the instructions again and see that some registrars require a &ldquo;.&rdquo; at the end of the value. So I added my &ldquo;.&quot;&rsquo;s and went on with my course.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/E9IwVdb.png" alt="Imgur"></p>
<p>From here it was like a guided walkthrough of Google workspace. It took me through the features and had me do a little task in each. Things like adding users, making mailing groups, settings different users, and groups of users to have different permissions. All and all it was a fun course to go through and see some of the tools an IT manager has at their disposal and I look forward to what tomorrow brings me.</p>
<p>Codesignal was un-eventful today, I completed this <a href="https://app.codesignal.com/arcade/intro/level-2/yuGuHvcCaFCKk56rJ">Shape area</a>. I looked for a pattern to no avail for a solid 15 minutes. Before going to google to look up what the heck an interesting polygon was and was met with thousands of answers to this exact same problem. Not understanding most of them, and not being comfortable &ldquo;borrowing&rdquo; code that I don&rsquo;t understand, I spent a while finding an answer.</p>

<p>Ever since I was little I have been fascinated by video games and everything about them. As I have been learning to code, naturally I have been very interested in how video games are made but with no experience building video games and less than a year of experience writing code, it seemed like a tall order. But I was still curious and ended up following a tutorial to build a Space Invaders inspired game from a tutorial I found in <a href="https://nostarch.com/pythoncrashcourse2e">Python crash course</a> by Eric Matthes.</p>
<p>The idea started to form as the tutorial walked me through setting up high scores for the game. Still, a problem that bugged me immediately was that there was no persistence there so as soon as I exited the app the high scores were gone forever and I would never be able to brag to my friends about my sweet new score. After the tutorial was finished I went back and refactored it to save the high scores locally but that still seemed hollow to me in today&rsquo;s connected world. After a little research on how bigger games handle this problem, I learned that my plan wouldn&rsquo;t be perfect – anyone with an account could make an API call directly to the server and have an impossibly high score. Real online games handle this a lot of the time by keeping state server side to make sure there is nothing fishy going on. This would require a full refactor and be outside of the score for this project. With a notepad full of ideas and notes, I started writing a server that takes care of authentication and keeps track of the high scores. With plenty of ideas for the future, such as seasonal high scores, a personal top ten, and some sweet power-up for your ship in the game, I decided to focus on getting this first idea shipped.</p>
<p>I began designing the server component for it, that being the part that I had done before. I used Django to keep track of the users and cookie-based authentication which did the brunt of the work for me. I ended up only needing four routes to make this happen: signup, a login, a submit score, and a get score to make this game run but ended up adding a get users and get all scores for testing purposes and it seemed like they would be helpful to have in the future.</p>
<p>Once the server was done, it was time to hook the game up to it, and honestly, I was at a loss. I knew exactly as much of Pygame as the tutorial had taught me, which unfortunately for me was not the same knowledge I needed to do what I wanted to do. Improvements like adding multiple screens to the game, having error boxes pop up, and making requests to an API were all beyond the scope of the tutorial and just beyond my knowledge level. I spent a few days thinking about the overall design of the game and how I could slip a login screen into it without refactoring the whole thing. Once I felt I had a clear path I jumped in and started coding. I knew I needed to make a screen with text boxes for username and password and buttons to navigate through the different screens, a similar screen to register an account, and a few well-placed requests. At the end of the project, it ended up pretty much how I had planned in the beginning.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/o4OH62y.png" alt="Imgur"></p>
<h2 id="deployment">Deployment</h2>
<p>While the coding of the project went well the deployment was rocky, because the server was going to be hosted remotely I decided that dockerizing it would be the best path. Docker is a great tool that I have used once before and was happy to get some more experience with so that part was pretty straightforward. Pairing it with Nginx so that it could talk to the container took me a while and I needed a fair bit of help to get it done. The deployment process looks roughly like this.</p>
<ul>
<li>pull the project from the repo on the server</li>
<li>build the docker container</li>
<li>set up Postgres</li>
<li>run the docker container</li>
<li>set up Nginx</li>
<li>???</li>
<li>profit</li>
</ul>
<p>Editor’s Note: The challenges with Nginx were primarily deploying the application in a container but running Nginx on the host as a reverse proxy for multiple applications.</p>
<h2 id="distribution">Distribution</h2>
<p>I thought distributing the game would be easy. Until I started writing the readme for the repo and as I write my technical docs as if I was explaining them to my grandma I knew I was losing a lot of potential users if my install instructions included the command line. I looked around and found <a href="https://pyinstaller.org/en/stable/">Pyinstaller</a> and learned how to use that. After two days of making sure I have the right python version installed and studying which flags to use to get a single executable (including the fact that even if Pyinstaller said that my game was one file I still had to make sure to package my assets into the root directory) I finally had it. Executables for both Mac and windows, which I had to build on their respective machines. I moved the binary to my wife&rsquo;s computer and tried to run it… only to be met with a windows defender alert. So I ran it through <a href="https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/42bddc5b361faa09bc1b346dc8c83d752e3041cb4b3da3d1a9bb010bac4094d3?nocache=1">virus total</a> and found that 6 security vendors flagged it as malware. It turns out a package that pyinstaller uses was flagged as <a href="https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller/issues/6754">malware</a>. It seems this is a known problem and I am not the first person to encounter it. I decided that I had sunk enough time into this part of the project and decided to try to build binaries in a later version.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Looking back, this project gave me more experience building an API with authentication and gave me a reason to use Docker and Nginx again. I feel I need a lot more experience with the deployment side of development, so it was valuable to practice it here. But I think I would not do a project like this by myself again. I found myself spending too much time doing things that I didn&rsquo;t enjoy, like lining everything up, and not enough time doing what I did enjoy, building functional features.</p>

<p>I started this project as a way to break out of the rut I found myself in during the planning phase for a much larger app. With no concrete intentions other than exploring a few different APIs and building something cool, I started writing, researching, experimenting, and now I’m extremely happy to present the result of this endeavour: Addy the Discord Bot.</p>
<p>During my exploration with Addy there have been many hurdles and many lessons learned.</p>
<p>Here are some of the things I have learned from the journey so far:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>How to handle third party APIs with less than stellar documentation and design</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How to save data without making a database</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The python requests library, and how to handle it&rsquo;s response object</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Explored Python&rsquo;s dictionary and it&rsquo;s functions</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Addy doesn’t have a central theme as she really was meant to be a personal project, thus each of her commands came about simply from asking myself “Wouldn’t it be cool if…?” Here are some of the things she can do now:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Look up a player in Runescape3</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create and add to a watch2gether room for you and your friends</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Offer a word of encouragement or tell you a quote from Brooklyn 99</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course every new feature sparks ideas for other improvements and the list keeps growing, but here are the additions I would like to make in the near future:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A backend to complement her, and allow to me save data more reliably.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A way for her to play music in a voice channel (worried about the legality here).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A Runescape item price look-up. (Their api is really bad, the easiest way to do this is to build a webcrawler and crawl their api once a week)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you have a cool idea for Addy, contact me and let me know!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are interested in seeing Addy in action, I have set up a <a href="https://discord.gg/a5EXHbGwzH">discord server</a> for you to try. The browser version of discord doesn&rsquo;t require you to log in. Jump right in and type !help to see all of her commands. a more in depth explanation can be found <a href="https://github.com/Acer0ni/Addy-the-disc-bot/blob/main/README.md">here.</a></p>

<p>Budget book was our first time working with other developers on a major project. We set off to make a full Stack budgeting application that took in your monthly income and expenses, and told you how much remaining and let you set goals to work for i.e vacations.</p>
<p>I worked mostly on the back end for this project but did help on some of the front end logic with the api calls. the back end turned out pretty much how I expected it to after several iteration.</p>
<p>It seemed like everything was going alright early on, we had spent a bunch of time planning the front end thinking the back end would be self explanatory&hellip; it was not.  We ran into issues immediately with the back end not returning things the front end devs thought they would, we fixed this by working very closely the rest of the week and over communicating.</p>
<p>This project really taught me the importance of having a solid design in both your front and back end and really to be clear in your api documentation.</p>

<p>This project started off as a full stack app, intending to be my capstone project for my bootcamp. It was meant to be a technology forum for me and my cohorts to compile our resources. We had five days to complete this project.</p>
<p>Not knowing anything about Django-Ninja coming in, or anything about cookie based authentication, I spent more time studying than coding, and did not finish the front end. However, I did end up with a fully functional secure api with cookie based authentication.</p>
<p>One immediate challenge was the lack of Django-Ninja docs written on a beginner level. So there was a lot of struggle trying to fit django-ninja into what i already knew about DRF.</p>
<p>I had a lot of fun with Django-Ninjas auto-docs. They made testing very easy. My most valuable lesson from this project came in the form of setting realistic expectations when incorporating a new technology into a build. Django-Ninja did make the process much quicker once I had done enough research to fully understand it, however I underestimated the amount of time it took to get to that point which caused a delay in finishing the project.</p>
