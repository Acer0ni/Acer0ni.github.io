Today&amp;rsquo;s course was Google Workspace Security. It went over the security features of Google workspace and how to use them. There was a lot more reading than usual for the courses. Although I did do things like setting up and enforcing 2fa on a company-wide level, and changing session controls so that users will log out more often and single sign-on.</description></item><item><title>Managing Google Workspace</title><link>/posts/2022/idday2/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Aug 2022 18:07:07 -0700</pubDate><guid>/posts/2022/idday2/</guid><description>Today I started late due to a doctor&amp;rsquo;s appointment in the morning that ended up taking about half of the time that I would prefer to be working so I skipped codesignal today and jumped to my next course as soon as I got home. Today I took Managing Google Workspace. It followed the same format as the last one: an intro video to introduce the section, a couple of guided assignments followed by a quiz to ensure you understood it.</description></item><item><title>IT Day One</title><link>/posts/2022/itday1/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Aug 2022 13:54:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>/posts/2022/itday1/</guid><description>Well, after being put off by almost a week due to a freak power outage, today was day one of my eight-week IT crash course put together by my friend. It started off a little rocky as the Introduction to Google Workspace Administration I followed today, assuming I was starting fresh and buying a domain and letting google set up their DNS records. Since I already had a domain, and no spare money, I decided not to do this and go through with using my own domain for this course.</description></item><item><title>Alien invasion</title><link>/posts/2022/alien_invasion/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Jul 2022 12:35:47 -0700</pubDate><guid>/posts/2022/alien_invasion/</guid><description>Ever since I was little I have been fascinated by video games and everything about them. As I have been learning to code, naturally I have been very interested in how video games are made but with no experience building video games and less than a year of experience writing code, it seemed like a tall order. But I was still curious and ended up following a tutorial to build a Space Invaders inspired game from a tutorial I found in Python crash course by Eric Matthes.</description></item><item><title>Meet Addy</title><link>/posts/2022/addy/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Mar 2022 15:25:33 -0700</pubDate><guid>/posts/2022/addy/</guid><description>I started this project as a way to break out of the rut I found myself in during the planning phase for a much larger app. With no concrete intentions other than exploring a few different APIs and building something cool, I started writing, researching, experimenting, and now I’m extremely happy to present the result of this endeavour: Addy the Discord Bot.
During my exploration with Addy there have been many hurdles and many lessons learned.</description></item><item><title>Welcome</title><link>/welcome/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jan 2022 11:30:40 -0800</pubDate><guid>/welcome/</guid><description>Hey!

Expenses can be edited and deleted, with the user’s remaining monthly balance updating automatically to match.
Budget book was our first time working with other developers on a major project. We set off to make a full Stack budgeting application that took in your monthly income and expenses, and told you how much remaining and let you set goals to work for i.</description></item><item><title>Project: Forum API</title><link>/posts/2022/forum-api/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Jan 2022 12:28:01 -0800</pubDate><guid>/posts/2022/forum-api/</guid><description>This is a database for a user-generated chat forum that is ready to be paired with a front-end UI. It uses the Django-Ninja framework, Postgres, and cookie based authentication. Intended for use as a technology forum, but is suitable for multiple industries.
This project started off as a full stack app, intending to be my capstone project for my bootcamp. It was meant to be a technology forum for me and my cohorts to compile our resources.</description></item><item><title>Projects</title><link>/projects/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Jan 2022 12:28:01 -0800</pubDate><guid>/projects/</guid><description>Addy I started this project as a way to break out of the rut I found myself in during the planning phase for a much larger app. With no concrete intentions other than exploring a few different APIs and building something cool, I started writing, researching, experimenting, and now I’m extremely happy to present the result of this endeavour: Addy the Discord Bot.

Not the most technically challenging project by any means, but from that point on I was hooked. I simply had to know how these things worked.
From that first simple lesson, family has played a huge role in my progression as a programmer.</description></item><item><title/><link>/thankyou/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/thankyou/</guid><description>Thanks for reaching out!
