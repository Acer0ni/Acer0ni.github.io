Expenses can be edited and deleted, with the user’s remaining monthly balance updating automatically to match.
Budget book was our first time working with other developers on a major project. We set off to make a full Stack budgeting application that took in your monthly income and expenses, and told you how much remaining and let you set goals to work for i.</description><content>&lt;p>&lt;img src="/project-pictures/bb-pic.png" alt="BB-pic">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I worked mostly on the back end for this project but did help on some of the front end logic with the api calls. the back end turned out pretty much how I expected it to after several iteration.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It seemed like everything was going alright early on, we had spent a bunch of time planning the front end thinking the back end would be self explanatory&amp;hellip; it was not. We ran into issues immediately with the back end not returning things the front end devs thought they would, we fixed this by working very closely the rest of the week and over communicating.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This project really taught me the importance of having a solid design in both your front and back end and really to be clear in your api documentation.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This project started off as a full stack app, intending to be my capstone project for my bootcamp. It was meant to be a technology forum for me and my cohorts to compile our resources. We had five days to complete this project.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Not knowing anything about Django-Ninja coming in, or anything about cookie based authentication, I spent more time studying than coding, and did not finish the front end. However, I did end up with a fully functional secure api with cookie based authentication.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One immediate challenge was the lack of Django-Ninja docs written on a beginner level. So there was a lot of struggle trying to fit django-ninja into what i already knew about DRF.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I had a lot of fun with Django-Ninjas auto-docs. They made testing very easy. My most valuable lesson from this project came in the form of setting realistic expectations when incorporating a new technology into a build. Django-Ninja did make the process much quicker once I had done enough research to fully understand it, however I underestimated the amount of time it took to get to that point which caused a delay in finishing the project.&lt;/p>

Not the most technically challenging project by any means, but from that point on I was hooked. I simply had to know how these things worked.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>From that first simple lesson, family has played a huge role in my progression as a programmer. What started as a fun project with Gramps turned into a lifelong shared passion, and now has become the means of providing for my own family. Including my daughter who recently had her very first programming lesson, at the age of 4 just like I did.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I love the idea of using my skills as a programmer to build technologies that improve the lives of the people around me. One example of this is a project I worked on in college that utilized BCI(Brain Computer Interfacing), and it has been a lifelong goal of mine to increase the accessibility of computers for everyone.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Currently, I am in the planning stage of a paper crypto trading site.&lt;/p>
