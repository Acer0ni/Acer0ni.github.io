&lt;p>I worked mostly on the back end for this project but did help on some of the front end logic with the api calls. the back end turned out pretty much how I expected it to after several iteration.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It seemed like everything was going alright early on, we had spent a bunch of time planning the front end thinking the back end would be self explanatory&amp;hellip; it was not. We ran into issues immediately with the back end not returning things the front end devs thought they would, we fixed this by working very closely the rest of the week and over communicating.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This project really taught me the importance of having a solid design in both your front and back end and really to be clear in your api documentation.&lt;/p>
