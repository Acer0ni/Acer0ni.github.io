As I have been learning to code, naturally I have been very interested in how video games are made but with no experience building video games and less than a year of experience writing code, it seemed like a tall order. But I was still curious and ended up following a tutorial to build a Space Invaders inspired game from a tutorial I found in <a href=https://nostarch.com/pythoncrashcourse2e>Python crash course</a> by Eric Matthes.</p><p>Additionally I built a high scores server and created a login and sign-up system for users. For more information, check out the <a href=/posts/2022/alien_invasion/>blog post</a>.</p><p><a href=https://github.com/Acer0ni/alien-invasion>Alien invasion repo</a></p><p><a href=https://github.com/Acer0ni/alien-invasion-api>Backend repo</a></p><h2 id=budget-book>Budget Book</h2><p><img src=/project-pictures/bb-pic.png alt=BB-pic></p><p>Budgetbook is a minimalist budget tracking app. The user starts by inputting their monthly income, then adds expenses with dollar values which are automatically subtracted from the monthly total. Expenses can be edited and deleted, with the user’s remaining monthly balance updating automatically to match.</p><p>Budget book was our first time working with other developers on a major project. We set off to make a full Stack budgeting application that took in your monthly income and expenses, and told you how much remaining and let you set goals to work for i.e vacations.</p><p>I worked mostly on the back end for this project but did help on some of the front end logic with the api calls. the back end turned out pretty much how I expected it to after several iteration.</p><p>It seemed like everything was going alright early on, we had spent a bunch of time planning the front end thinking the back end would be self explanatory&mldr; it was not. We ran into issues immediately with the back end not returning things the front end devs thought they would, we fixed this by working very closely the rest of the week and over communicating.</p><p>This project really taught me the importance of having a solid design in both your front and back end and really to be clear in your api documentation.</p><p><a href=https://github.com/Team-formerly-known-as/budget-book-backend>Github repo backend</a></p><p><a href=https://github.com/Team-formerly-known-as/budget-book-frontend>Github repo Frontend</a></p><p><a href=https://team-formerly-known-as.github.io/budget-book-frontend/>Live site</a></p></div></article><hr><div class=post-info><p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="feather feather-tag meta-icon"><path d="M20.59 13.41l-7.17 7.17a2 2 0 01-2.83.0L2 12V2h10l8.59 8.59a2 2 0 010 2.82z"/><line x1="7" y1="7" x2="7" y2="7"/></svg><span class=tag><a href=/tags//></a></span></p></div></main></div><footer class=footer></footer></div><script type=text/javascript src=/bundle.min.feebdc8d801e3fb1791305e362b6d11557f029604dd5b3c27e2686bc88787ee90ae1ccf0afe81bd7d959d7617cfe1fc73062aa82b4e1fa830d6941193d2cbddf.js integrity="sha512-/uvcjYAeP7F5EwXjYrbRFVfwKWBN1bPCfiaGvIh4fukK4czwr+gb19lZ12F8/h/HMGKqgrTh+oMNaUEZPSy93w=="></script></body></html>
